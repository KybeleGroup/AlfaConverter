**Install AlfaConverter**

The fastest and most recommended way to use the SmaC tool is to use the INNoVaSerV IDE which already incorporates the SmaC plugins to implement smart contracts in Solidity.

You just need to download the tool, unzip the file and click on the executable. The tool already incorporates 3 contracts obtained from the official Solidity documentation
